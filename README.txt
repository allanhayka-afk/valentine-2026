1. Add her favorite song as: her_song.mp3
2. Add photos as: photo1.jpg to photo8.jpg
3. Open index.html to preview
4. Upload to GitHub Pages / Netlify to share

Notes for GitHub Pages compatibility:
- Filenames have been normalized to lowercase and spaces removed (e.g., `background.jpg`, `photo1.jpg` ... `photo8.jpg`) to avoid case/space issues on Linux hosts.
- Consider converting images to WebP and optimizing (resize and compress) before publishing for better performance.
- If you want a quick conversion script using ImageMagick or PowerShell, say so and I'll add it.
